# SQL Filtering for Security Investigation Portfolio

This repository showcases a completed portfolio activity from the Google Cybersecurity Certificate program. It demonstrates how SQL filtering techniques can be used to investigate suspicious login activity and support system security updates across departments.

## 🗂️ Contents

- `SQL_Filtering_for_Security_Investigation.pdf` – The main portfolio document with all SQL queries, explanations, and scenario-based analysis.
- `table formats.docx` – Supporting reference material describing the schema for the `employees` and `log_in_attempts` tables used in the queries.

## 📘 Project Description

As a security professional in a simulated corporate environment, I was responsible for investigating after-hours login attempts, filtering activity by date and location, and identifying which employee machines needed security updates. This project showcases how I used SQL to:

- Detect failed login attempts outside business hours
- Filter activity on specific suspicious dates
- Exclude login attempts from a specific country
- Retrieve employee records based on department and office location

## 🛠️ Skills Demonstrated

- SQL Data Filtering with `WHERE`, `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`
- Pattern Matching using `LIKE` and wildcards
- Date and Time-Based Filtering
- Querying Realistic Security Datasets
- Scenario-Based Investigation using SQL

## 📌 Why This Matters

Being able to filter large datasets quickly and accurately is a critical skill for cybersecurity analysts. This activity simulates real-world incidents where login data must be investigated and systems updated based on department roles and locations.

## 🔗 Certification Path

This portfolio activity is part of the **Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate – Course 4: Tools of the Trade – Linux and SQL**.
